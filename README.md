# KeypathSurvey
This project was an assignment during the interview process for a perspective employer. I had two days to complete it, and I successfully met the deadline.

Laravel 9 framework was used with vue.js.

The website is in the KeySurvey folder and the database is the survey.sql file.

Manually adding the type of "admin" to a user in the user table will give them admin access.
